PaaS-using-Docker
=================
Aim: Allow developers to deploy applications on cloud in a single click.

It provides a web based interface where:

		1. users can upload their source code and provide the underlying programming
		    languages used.
		2. users can login to manage their applications(like stop/restart the container,delete the
	                application,etc)

The system automatically resolves the dependencies,build the application and deploy it on the cloud. It then returns the url of the running application to the user.

Supported Languages:

1.  PHP with Mysql
2.  Python web2py framework
	
Benefits :

1. Save money & time.
2. Easy to deploy by na√Øve users as well
